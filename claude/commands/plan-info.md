## Instructions

1. **Check for Active Session Plan:**
   First, check if there's an active plan for this session:

   ```bash
   cc-plan session get-active --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" --test "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
   ```

   If no active session is found, try to get any plan for this session:

   ```bash
   cc-plan plan get --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID" --test "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
   ```

2. **Handle No Plan Found:**
   If no plan exists for this session:

   - Inform the user that no plan is currently associated with this session
   - Suggest using `/plan` to create a new plan
   - Suggest using `/plan-attach` to attach to an existing plan
   - Exit gracefully

3. **Display Plan Information:**
   If a plan is found, provide:

   - **Plan Overview:** Brief summary of what the plan aims to accomplish
   - **Current Status:** Whether it's active, how many tasks exist
   - **Key Components:** Main areas or files that will be modified
   - **Progress:** If tasks exist, show completion status

4. **Check for Tasks:**
   If a plan exists, also check for associated tasks:

   ```bash
   cc-plan tasks list --session-id "$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID"
   ```

   Display task summary:

   - Total number of tasks
   - Completed vs pending tasks
   - Current or next task to work on

5. **Handle User Questions:**
   If arguments are provided (user asked a specific question):

   - Analyze the question in context of the found plan and tasks
